#[README] Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repo is set for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project on Coursera. It contains this README.md, a run_analysis.R, and a CodeBook.md.

Source is originated from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip . After unzipping the files and running the script, an independent tidy dataset will be created, which is prepared to be used for later analysis.

For any other details please go to Cousera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data" by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD. Have fun!
